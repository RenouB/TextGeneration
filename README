# TextGeneration

Contains a Language Model module created for the Introduction to Programming course at the Institute for Computational Linguistics in Stuttgart, Germany, Fall 2018.
The main.py script opens an interactive environment for training the LM and then performing different actions. The user can choose between two different smoothing methods: LaPlace or Kneser-Ney.
In both cases, the user can choose the prefered n-gram order.

## files:

**lm.py** - language model class

**corpus.py** - different utilities for accessing and processing corpora adn text generated by the LM.

**main.py** - interactive script to train language model, use it to evaluate probabilities or automatically generate new texts

**test_languagemodel.py** - test suite for language model

**kn_test.txt** - text file used for testing

**empty.txt** - text file used for testing

**pdf.pdf** - pdf file used for testing

**dev_shakespeare.txt** - sample development data

**train_shakespeare.txt** - sample training data

## An example of the kinds of texts generated by the model:

*In faith, I will tell you is, that the duke hath dined. Get your apparel together, good strings to your beards, new ribbons to your pumps; meet presently at the palace; every man look o'er his part; for the short and the long is, our play is, the most lamentable comedy, and most cruel death of pyramus and thisby. A very good piece of work, I assure you. Well then, now have you consider'd of my speeches? Know that it was he in the times past which held you so under fortune, which you thought had been our innocent self: this I made good to you in our last conference, pass'd in probation with you, how you were brought into the orchard and saw me court margaret in hero's garments, how you disgraced her, when you should marry her: my villany they have upon record; which I had rather seal with my death than repeat over to my shame. The lady is dead upon mine and my master's false accusation; and, briefly, I desire nothing but the reward of a villain.*

*Boy, lucius! Varro! Claudius! Sirs, awake! Claudius! The strings, my lord, I fear, most just and heavy causes make oppose. Sir, you shall find us in our salt-water girdle: if you beat us out of it, it is yours; if you fall in the adventure, be my helps, as I am an honest puck, if we have unearned luck now to'scape the serpent's tongue, we will make amends ere long; else the puck a liar call; so, good night: to-morrow with your earliest let me have speech with you. Come, come you talk.*

*The place which I have feasted, does it now, like all mankind, show me an iron heart? Lucilius servant put in now, titus. My lord, entreat him by no means to stay. Alack, the night comes on, and the bleak winds do sorely ruffle; for many miles a bout there's scarce a bush. O, sir!*

*Out, cur! Thou drivest me past the bounds of maiden's patience. Hast thou slain him, then?*

*A figure like your father, armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe, appears before them, and with solemn march goes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk'd by their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes, within his truncheon's length; whilst they, distilled almost to jelly with the act of fear, stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me in dreadful secrecy impart they did; and I with them the third night kept the watch; where, as they say, lamentings heard I the air to stick: so, as a painted tyrant, pyrrhus stood, and like a neutral to his will and matter, did nothing. But, as we often see, against some storm, a silence in the heavens, the heavens to earth, 'now the king dunks to hamlet. Come, begin: and you, the judges, bear a wary eye. Come on, come on; go along with us.*
